            <p>A shoe is a type of footwear. It is an item of clothing. You can wear them outside. Shoes come in pairs,
                 with one shoe for each foot. People usually wear shoes in public. They are worn for hygiene, style, and 
                 comfort.
                 While there are some shoes that don't need socks to wear, shoes are usually worn with socks.</p>

                    <p class="product__description">There are many different types of shoes. Athletic shoes, for example, 
                        are lightweight to make running, walking or jogging easier. The sole of the shoe is also softer. 
                        Slippers are a kind of indoor shoe. 
                        They often serve to keep feet warm. Tall shoes are boots. Rubber boots are used in wet places.</p>

                    <p class="product__description">The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture,
                         with form originally being tied to function. Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and climate conditions, it is still vulnerable to environmental hazards such as sharp rocks and temperature extremes, which shoes protect against. Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such as steel-toe boots which are required footwear at industrial worksites. Additionally,
                         fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones.</p>

                    <p class="product__description">Contemporary footwear varies widely in style, complexity and cost. 
                        Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost.
                         High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for large sums of money.
                          Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing, 
                        while others have more generalized usage such as sneakers which have transformed from a special purpose sport shoe into a general use shoe. </p>
